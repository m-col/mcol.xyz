about this website
==================

:save_as: about.html
:template: blogroll

This blog is a place for me to jot down and share my notes on free and open
source software projects I create or stumble upon, on programming, and about
digital freedom and privacy.

I maintain this website for fun, but also want to support and encourage others
to use personal websites as an independent and decentralised means to share
ideas and communicate.

Feel free to reach out to me! I can usually be found hanging around on mastodon
at `@mcol@fosstodon.org <https://fosstodon.org/@mcol>`_, mcol on IRC or you can
email me at :code:`mcol` at :code:`posteo` dot :code:`net` [`pgp key`_].
